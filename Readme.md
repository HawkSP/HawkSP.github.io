# Evaluation of the Splash Out Project

---



# 1.1

---

### **Ethos**

My **_Ethos_**, strategic philosophy and direction revolves around the fact 

of **_Productivity_** and the whole **_Framework_** of this project derives upon 

hard work and perseverance and a lot of creative and logical input.

# 1.2

---

### **Introduction**

This evaluation provides evaluated information obtained by the creator Elliott Mitchell of the Splash Out Project

about the sections **_Splash Screen_**,  **_Welcome Screen_**,  **_Home Screen_**,  **_Navigation Screen_**,  **_Activities Movie_**,

 **_Try Surfing_**,  **_New This Year_** and  **_Find Out More_**. This evaluation will pay 

 particular attention to the quality of the pages and the functionality of each.

 The evaluation will comment on the behaviour of each section too and they will give the way of creation

 and the contents of reasoning.

# 1.3

---

### **Start-Up**

As you will load into the website you will be immediately recorded on **_Google Analytics_** for improved and more accurate

representations of **_Traffic_** and **_Retention_** on the webpage, which will improve the quality of the webpage because I can see the response to changes, for example, this is the traffic for this year: 

![alt text](https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/ActiveUsers.PNG?raw=true "Active Users From This Year")



You will be then granted with first:

* Splash Screen

* Welcome Screen



## 1.3.25

#### **Splash Screen**

The Splash Screen is a graphical control element consisting of a window containing an image, a logo and in this case an animated 

spinning circles. These are typically found on launching a program take **_Netflix_** such as:

## 1.3.75

---

##### **Welcome Screen** 

The Welcome screen consists of 5 elements the first being the "Welcome" with a back shadow in the house style font of Splash Out the

next is the "To The Splash Out Page", which presents people to what they are viewing. The next "To Proceed Click Continue", which

prompts the user to click continue to the "Homepage" but in a greener font. The 4th element is the button "Continue": this

will directly lead to the "Home Page" with a "href" to home.html this button has a **_CSS_** and **_Javascript_** glow on it which will 

hint to the user to click the button. Underneath the button, there will be 3 circles that are in a loop to keep enlarging

and decreasing in size (using WebKit).

# 1.4

### **Navigation Screen**

The Navigation screen is intergrated into every page and can be accessed with the "Open Nav Button" ("☰ open nav")  
![alt text](https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/OpenNav.png?raw=true "Open Nav Button")

The Navigation Screen is made from **_Java Script_** and **_CSS_** to make a professional looking **_Navigation Screen_**. When clicked on a page it will redirect you to that page using scripts and **_HTML_**. I made it as an overlay instead of a page because I wanted to make it **_Quicker_** loading times instead of being redirected to another page, which will reduce **_Retention Times_** due to if they have slow computers or internet as well I wanted to create an effect where you will be able to see the page in the background so it feels more like a website that is developed well. I have also added on the home page links to **Activites Movie**, **Try Surfing**, **New This Year**, **Find Out More**, **Page Info** and **FAQs**

### **Activities Movie**

The activities movie was made in VEGAS Pro 15 Suite 
![alt text]https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/vegas-pro-15-suite-screenshot-int.jpg?raw=true "VEGAS Pro 15")
VEGAS Pro 15 Suite can work with low-resolution audio or pristine 24-bit, 192kHz high-resolution audio and everything in between
mono, stereo, or 5.1 surround sound. Also you can use plugins and effects from leading developers Boris FX, HitFilm, and NewBlueFX.
These helped me in my development as they helped with the video due to its use of effect I could use.
