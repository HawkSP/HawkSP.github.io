# Evaluation of the Splash Out Project

---



# 1.1

---

### **Ethos**

My **_Ethos_**, strategic philosophy and direction revolves around the fact 

of **_Productivity_** and the whole **_Framework_** of this project derives upon 

hard work and perseverance and a lot of creative and logical input.

# 1.2

---

### **Introduction**

This evaluation provides evaluated information obtained by the creator Elliott Mitchell of the Splash Out Project

about the sections **_Splash Screen_**,  **_Welcome Screen_**,  **_Home Screen_**,  **_Navigation Screen_**,  **_Activities Movie_**,

 **_Try Surfing_**,  **_New This Year_** and  **_Find Out More_**. This evaluation will pay 

 particular attention to the quality of the pages and the functionality of each.

 The evaluation will comment on the behaviour of each section too and they will give the way of creation

 and the contents of reasoning.

# 1.3

---

### **Start-Up**

As you will load into the website you will be immediately recorded on **_Google Analytics_** for improved and more accurate

representations of **_Traffic_** and **_Retention_** on the webpage, which will improve the quality of the webpage because I can see the response to changes, for example, this is the traffic for this year: 

![alt text](https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/ActiveUsers.PNG?raw=true "Active Users From This Year")



You will be then granted with first:

* Splash Screen

* Welcome Screen



## 1.3.25

---

#### **Splash Screen**

The Splash Screen is a graphical control element consisting of a window containing an image, a logo and in this case an animated 

spinning circles. These are typically found on launching a program take **_Netflix_** such as:



[![](https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/NetflixSplashScreen.PNG?raw=true)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN1jB5UZ650 "Netflix Splash Screen")

## 1.3.75

---

##### **Welcome Screen** 

The Welcome screen consists of 5 elements the first being the "Welcome" with a back shadow in the house style font of Splash Out the

next is the "To The Splash Out Page", which presents people to what they are viewing. The next "To Proceed Click Continue", which

prompts the user to click continue to the "Homepage" but in a greener font. The 4th element is the button "Continue": this

will directly lead to the "Home Page" with a "href" to home.html this button has a **_CSS_** and **_Javascript_** glow on it which will 

hint to the user to click the button. Underneath the button, there will be 3 circles that are in a loop to keep enlarging

and decreasing in size (using WebKit).

### **Navigation Screen**

The Navigation screen is intergrated into every page and can be accessed with the "Open Nav Button" ("☰ open nav")  
![alt text](https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/OpenNav.png?raw=true "Open Nav Button")

The Navigation Screen is made from **_Java Script_** and **_CSS_** to make a professional looking **_Navigation Screen_**. When clicked on a page it will redirect you to that page using scripts and **_HTML_**. I made it as an overlay instead of a page because I wanted to make it **_Quicker_** loading times instead of being redirected to another page, which will reduce **_Retention Times_** due to if they have slow computers or internet as well I wanted to create an effect where you will be able to see the page in the background so it feels more like a website that is developed well. I have also added on the home page links to **Activites Movie**, **Try Surfing**, **New This Year**, **Find Out More**, **Page Info** and **FAQs** next time I would make a more interactive "Nav Screen" with more usability.

### **Activities Movie**

The activities movie was made in VEGAS Pro 15 Suite 
![alt text](https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/vegas-pro-15-suite-screenshot-int.jpg?raw=true "VEGAS Pro 15")
VEGAS Pro 15 Suite can work with low-resolution audio or pristine 24-bit, 192kHz high-resolution audio and everything in between
mono, stereo, or 5.1 surround sound. Also, you can use plugins and effects from leading developers Boris FX, HitFilm, and NewBlueFX.
These helped me in my development as they helped with the video due to its use of effect I could use. My options were also to use after Effects from Adobe or DaVinci Resolve but I am not as skilled in them but I am in Sony Vegas. If I was to redesign the **Activites Movie** I would take a more refined approach with the use of origninal footage and original music due to my skills in music producing I would make a track specifically for the activities movie (you can see my tracks at [``SoundCloud``](https://www.soundcloud.com/hawksp).

### **Try Surfing**

#### **Program (Google Web Designer)**
This animation was made using **Google Web Designer** and this software is typically used create engaging, interactive HTML5-based designs and motion graphics that can run on any device, however, I used it to make an animation because it let me focus on design
and they handled the HTML5 and CSS3 so that I was free to focus on the animations appearance: creating a gorgeous visual experience. As well it let my vision be forged in this program.

![alt text](https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/GoogleWebDesigner.PNG?raw=true "Google Web Designer")

#### **Animation**
This animation is quite **clunky** with it not flowing as smoothly as I wanted it to be. The animation also used non-original assets within the animation I would have used custom-made assets using hand drawing or pixel drawing to make it look better with a more of my own finish upon the animation. My Try Surfing animation was also very static, which displeased me, however, it would have taken a lot of effort to draw out each frame of the Dolphin this made it look very unprofessional but it turned out to what my desires were.

![alt text](https://github.com/HawkSP/HawkSP.github.io/blob/master/TrySurfingImage.PNG?raw=true "Try Surfing Animation")

#### **Design Thoughts**
When I was designing this animation I was thinking how could I make it so users would be appealed by my animation not for how unproffessional it looks and embracing schadenfreude instead for how proffessional it looked, however, to make original assets deemed quite a challenge due to how inconsitant a white board pen is: to make the animation I used a whiteboard and a whiteboard pen for the boldness of the lines and the whiteness of the background it would be easy to take the white out without losing any of the actual image. This didn't turn out so well considering that drawing with a whiteboard pen is difficult to potray details so it turned out to be very heavy and made the image not look the best as well as the previous ink on the board was not rubbed of to 100% so there were some random dots of black, which made it look unproffesional. 

The next stage was the capturing of the image, which was me using an Iphone 6s+ 12mp camera this was a bad choice due to the lack of pixels that were missed out due to lack of quality in the camera. Then imported into photoshop where I would get rid of the white background and fill the outline in and fill the image with the desired colours, which worked well due to it now looking like a well made graphic, however due to the static nature of the animation it looked odd.

#### **Design 1**

### **New This Year**

#### **The Code:**
I did this using a JavaScript function I made called showSlides that will show the slides after a certain time it will change the image after every 2000 ms, which is around 2 seconds. The CSS used adds 3 dots at the bottom, which will show progression of the images 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3. The HTML5 I used is to position it on the page and combining the CSS and JavaScript together. Also there is a link to the activites when you click on them.

#### **The Images**
The images that I used are very high quality been 4k (4096x2304) and they were optimized to a certain extent but but are poorly optimized, however, I didn't want to lose the quality of the images so I left them but loading times are heavily extended.

### **Find Out More**

#### **The Code:**
For this page I used a combination of HTML,CSS and JS like usual but this time I used some Google APIs (Application Programming Interface) specifically the Google Maps API, to show the location of the place. Then I used a form made on HTML and CSS that consisted of a dropdown box to show, which activity you thought was your favourite and you will be taken to the activity you picked on click. Also there is some space for you to type you name and your email and message and when you click the submit button it will launch an action_page.php, which due to the non-commercial use of this page consists of no database linked to it. But if I was to do it again it will utillise a working version. If I was to change anything I would change the usabillty of it and flesh it out with features .

#### **APIs**
The use for the APIs for this brouchure was essential because without them it wouldn't look fleshed out and because of this map a user would know the location of the company.
